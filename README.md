About the ZFS filesystem
=============================

The [ZFS][1] filesystem is an alternative to [XFS][5].
While introduced originally in the [Solaris][4] OS,
[ZFS][1] has been ported to [ZFS_on_Linux][2].
See also the [OpenZFS][3] developers page.

We have written a quick [guide for configuring ZFS][6].

Tools for the ZFS filesystem
=============================

The files in the present repository augment the tools provided by the
[ZFS][1] software stack.
Mainly lacking are tools for handling **user disk quotas**.
